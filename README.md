### TF-IDF approach accuracy 

SVM - 90.44% <br>
Logistic Regression - 88.9% <br>
Naive Bayes - 88.51% <br>
Decision Tree - 69.33% <br>
Random Forest  - 85.35% <br>

### Neural network with Embedding layer 
Accuracy with 10 epochs - 86%-88% <br>
Adding a Convolution layer - 86%-88% (The time required to train decreases significantly in this case)
